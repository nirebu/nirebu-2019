A little place to fool around with new things and post some ramblings in a blog

## Next steps

Not a comprehensive list of things I want to do

### Code styling

Styling for embedded blocks of code

### Vuex integration

I want to make the process to grab the blog posts (correlating the slugs to the filenames) more robust storing them in the Vuex store, so I can said data to display a blog posts list without having to fetch read the file system again. Also, I will be able to decouple the slugs from the filenames.

### Latest articles component

To showcase the most recent articles in the home page

### Last.fm integration

I want to design a page and some Vue components, consuming data fetched from my [last.fm profile](https://last.fm/user/nirebu/)
